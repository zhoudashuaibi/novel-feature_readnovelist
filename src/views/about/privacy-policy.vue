    <div class="content-p">
      A. Introduction<br><br>
      Your service provider is Union Read Limited, a company operating under the laws of HongKong, located at HongKong. We recognize that your privacy is very important, and we take it seriously. Your privacy and trust are very important to us, and it is our commitment to being transparent about the use of collected information.<br><br>
      This Privacy Policy describes NOVELPROJECT’s policies and procedures on the collection, use, disclosure, and sharing of your personal information or personal data, and the choices you can make about how we use this information when you access or use our Site, Application, and/or Services.<br><br>
      Note that NOVELPROJECT’s Terms of Service apply to this Privacy Policy. By accessing or using the NOVELPROJECT website and application, you are consenting that you unconditionally accept this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms found on this Privacy Policy, please do not use the NOVELPROJECT Services.<br><br>
      THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS IMPORTANT. WE HOPE YOU WILL TAKE THE TIME TO READ IT CAREFULLY.<br><br>
      B. Age restrictions<br><br>
      NOVELPROJECT is not intended for children. Children under the age of 13 must not use our Site, Application, and/or Services for any purpose. NOVELPROJECT will never knowingly solicit or accept personally identifiable information or other content from a user or visitor who NOVELPROJECT knows is under 13 years of age. If NOVELPROJECT discovers that a user under 13 years of age has created an account, or that a user or visitor under 13 years of age has posted personally identifiable information or other content to the Service, NOVELPROJECT will terminate the account and remove the information or other content.<br><br>
      Users between 13 and 18 (each a “Teen”) may not access or use the Service unless (i) both the Teen and their parent or legal guardian have first agreed to these Terms of Service; and (ii) the Teen uses an account established by their parent or legal guardian, under such parent or guardian’s supervision, and with such parent or guardian’s permission. If you permit a Teen to use the Services, you hereby agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of both yourself and the Teen. You further agree that you are solely responsible for any and all use of the Service by your Teen regardless of whether such use was authorized by you.<br><br>
      C. Data Collection<br><br>
      We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services– from figuring out basic stuff such as which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the author who matter most to you online or which stories you might like.<br><br>
      When you interact with our Site, Application, and/or Services, we collect information that could be used to identify you (“Personal Data”). Some of the information we collect is stored in a manner that cannot be linked back to you (“Non-Personal Data”).<br><br>
      When you log in, we collect information that we store with your account (typically your nickname, email address, and a password for your account), which we treat as personal information. This log information may include but not limited to your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and cookie data. If you log into NOVELPROJECT with a social networking credential, such as with a third-party account, we will ask permission to access basic information from that account, such as your name and email address. You can stop sharing that information with us at any time by removing NOVELPROJECT’s access to that account. When you do not log in to our services, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the application and device you’re using. This collection helps us do things such as maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.<br><br>
      We collect your payment information if you are a paying customer. This information is required to complete a commercial transaction on our Applications and our Sites. We use this information to enable and fulfill your transaction. If you choose to use any third-party’s service to finalize and pay for your order, you will provide your credit card number directly to the third-party. The privacy policy of the third-party will apply to the information you provide on its website.<br><br>
      If you choose to participate in our survey, we may request certain Information (including Personal Data and Non-Personal Data) from you, and this information will be used to provide personalized help and instructions.<br><br>
      The information we collect and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.<br><br>
      D. Use of your data<br><br>

      E. Cookies<br><br>
      We use cookies to provide, protect, and promote our products.<br><br>

      F. Information Sharing<br><br>
      a. Shared information on our Site, Application, and/or Services<br><br>
      Any information that you include in your publicly-visible NOVELPROJECT profile, which may include your profile ID, nickname, photo and your personal introduction will be shared on our Site, Application, and/or Services to maintain your account in accordance with your instructions and requests.<br><br>
      b. Sharing Your Data outside of our Site, Application, and/or Services<br><br>
      Some NOVELPROJECT-related features allow you to provide Shared Information to those outside of your NOVELPROJECT network. For example, publicly accessible blogs and forums, or certain social media features within NOVELPROJECT (such as "plug-ins" (which create a direct link between two websites)) allow you to re-post and disclose Shared Information. If you share information using these features, third parties unrelated to us may be able to see and use it.<br><br>
      The information we share with such a third party is described to you when you first use that service or feature, and we require that the third party provide the same or equal protection of user data as stated in this policy. You can control which third parties have access to this information in your account. You can withdraw your agreement to the sharing of that information at any time by following the instructions set out here. Please note that if you ask us not to share that information with the third party, you may no longer be able to use that service or feature. We are not responsible for any third party use of any Information provided by you to them.<br><br>
      We do not rent or sell your personal information to other companies or individuals unless we have your consent.<br><br>
      G. Information Security<br><br>
      We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or data destruction.<br><br>
      We restrict access to your personal information to our staff who need to know that information to operate, develop or improve our services.<br><br>
      H. Updating your Information<br><br>
      We provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your personally identifying information and non-personal information for many of our services.<br><br>
      You also have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. You also have the right to correct that information.<br><br>
      You can access and correct your personal information by logging into your account at any time.<br><br>
      With respect to correction requests, where we agree that the Personal Information is inaccurate or incomplete, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can rectify the Personal Information too.<br><br>
      I. Deletion of your data<br><br>
      You can request deletion of your data at any time by contact us at service-novelproject@gmail.com . We will evaluate such requests on a case by case basic. We may keep some of your data for as long as reasonably necessary for our legitimate business interests, including fraud detection and prevention and to comply with our legal obligations including tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations. Sometimes, your request will only be satisfied by closing your account.<br><br>
      You have the ability to delete your Account, and you should understand that upon deletion of your Account, you will lose the right to access or use all or part of the Platform.<br><br>
      J. Changes to this policy<br><br>
      We change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We always indicate the date when the last changes were published and we offer access to archived versions for your review. If changes are significant, we’ll provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, inbox notification of Privacy Policy changes). Such changes will be used for any and all the information provided by those who have visited, used, or accessed the Service at the time they created their account or any point thereafter. Please note that, by accessing or using the NOVELPROJECT Platform, you are consenting that you unconditionally accept the updated Privacy Policy.<br><br>
      K. Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Platforms<br><br>
      NOVELPROJECT allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within NOVELPROJECT’s Platform. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send the advertisements and links that appear on NOVELPROJECT directly to you. They automatically receive your IP address when the advertising happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure their advertisements’ effectiveness and personalize the advertising content you see.<br><br>
      NOVELPROJECT does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.<br><br>
      You should consult these third-party ad servers or ad networks’ respective privacy policies for more information on their practices and instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. NOVELPROJECT’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or websites.
